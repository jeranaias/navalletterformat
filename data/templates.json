Traditional methods of creating naval letters often resulted in formatting inconsistencies, regulatory non-compliance, and significant time expenditure on administrative tasks that could be better spent on mission-essential functions.  This tool automates the formatting process while maintaining strict adherence to established standards, thereby improving efficiency and ensuring uniformity across all generated correspondence."

The continuation header should appear approximately one inch from the top of subsequent pages and include the subject line with 'Cont'd' annotation and page number.  Following the continuation header, body text should resume with appropriate spacing.  This validation ensures documents of any length will render correctly without manual intervention or formatting adjustments by the user.  The importance of proper page break handling cannot be overstated, as official correspondence often extends beyond a single page when addressing complex matters requiring detailed explanation or comprehensive documentation.  Furthermore, the page break algorithm must account for paragraph integrity, avoiding orphaned lines at the bottom of pages or widowed lines at the top of continuation pages when possible.  The system should also ensure that subject lines within paragraphs remain attached to their corresponding paragraph text rather than appearing isolated at page boundaries."
