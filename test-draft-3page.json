This request encompasses 47 Marines currently enrolled in resident language training programs who have expressed intent to travel to their homes of record for the holiday period.

Current commercial airline schedules during the peak holiday travel period further complicate timely departure and return, with many routes showing limited availability and significant delays anticipated due to seasonal weather patterns.",
